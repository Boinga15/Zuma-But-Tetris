# Zuma-But-Tetris
A tetris-based game that is similar to Zuma, in that it uses temples, and has boss fights.

Zuma But Tetris is a tetris game that has boss fights. Play four different difficulties and conquer the temple of tetris with your skills. Modern rules of tetris apply, with a few classical rules mixed in to make things slightly more difficult.

The main point of the game is the boss fights. Every now and then, you'll have to face off against a guardian. Clear lines to deal damage to the guardian, while also keeping your board clear from their attacks. Each guardian will have a special ability they'll use to try catch you for a loop, so be ready for anything.
